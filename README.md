# Network Multiplayer Game - Space ships
by Joan Barduena and Josep Lleal
Space ship is a simple 2D game prototype using a skeleton of an engine provided at class. You can use your skills and laser to beat your opponents. 
## Instructions
Shoot to your enemies to kill them and recover health. Be the last space ship alive to win! 

**Down Arrow** - Go forward 

**Left Arrow** - Shoot lasers

**A** - Rotate left 

**D** - Rotate right

## Implemented features
### Developed by Joan
Completely Achieved: 
- **Overcoming packet loss using redundancy:** From client, we send all generated inputs until the server notifies their reception updating inputDataFront to avoid sending already processed input data. If we don't receive the server notification, we resend the last sent inputs plus the new ones using redundancy. With this technique we overcome packet loss with input data.
- **Delegates from Delivery Manager:** When we send a replication packet a ReplicationDelegate is created and stores all the commands sent. In case a delivery packet times out, the delegate will only resend the type of replication action for each command from the packet. In case of DeliverySucess we do nothing. 
- **Client Prediction:** If there is high lattency (and client prediction is enabled), from the client we process the inputs directly every frame so inputs feels more instantaneous. 
### Developed by Josep
Completely Achieved: 
- **World State Replication:** From the server side, we keep track of all the event notification that happen for each game object serializing its fields and after some time send a replication packet to all the clients. Then, from the client side we read the replication packet deserializing its fields.
- **Delivery Manager:** From the server side it keeps track of all the replication packets sent. From the client side, we keep track of all the replication packets that have arrived and everytime we send an input packet we also send the sequence number of all the acknowledge replication packets. When the server receives the acknowledge packet it  deletes those deliveries since they have succesfully arrived. When the delivery manager notices a time out delivery it calls the delegate to resend the packet. 
- **Entity Interpolation:** It makes feel that networked objects controlled by other players are being continuously updated, even when receiving updates at a (relatively) low frequency. The interpolation is done with the current replication packet and the previous one so the network objects are seen with a little bit of delay.
- **Health packet mechanic (Extra):** Each time a player kills another player, a health packet is dropped where it died and it can be picked only by the player that killed him restoring all his hp.
